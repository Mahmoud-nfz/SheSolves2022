# SheSolves 5.0 ProblemSet

## Format:

Each problem setter should include the following files in his problem folder for the problem to be considered complete:

- problem statement (preferably in markdown or .txt format instead of docx to make the work of those who review/edit/format your document faster)
- An optimal solution in c++ (AC)
- A python or java solution (optional: across all problems we should have at least one problem with a java & python implementation)  
- A solution that implements a naive/brute force approach (should return TLE when tested by pc^2 ) 
- A test generator 
- between 30-50 tests:
	-  Those tests should be balanced (if a problem's output is either YES or NO the tests should be designed in a manner where the number of tests that should output "NO" is between 40%-60% of the total number of test cases) 
	- testxx.in should contain the input of test xx
	- testxx.out should contain the correct output of test xx verified by the proposed solution
	- The limit of the number of tests that should be manually done is 10 
	- The first tests (number 01 and 02 ) should be the same as those mentioned in your problem statement (this make figuring out the bugs easier for the participants)
