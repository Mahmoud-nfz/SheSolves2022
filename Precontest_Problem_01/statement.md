# PreContest Problem A : Doni and boring problems

## Statement:

Doni has for long been a fan of competitive programming but has found that there are some problems that are too boring for her.
A problem is boring for her if the time it takes to solve strictly exceeds 60 minutes.
You are given the time in minutes it takes to solve a problem, determine whether Doni will find it boring.

## Input :
The first line contains a single integer **T** (1≤T≤100) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of one line.

The first line contains an integer **n** (1≤ n ≤1000) — where n is the time in minutes it takes to solve a problem.

## Output :
For each test case, output "YES" (in capital letters) without the quotes if Doni will find it boring and "NO" otherwise.  

## Example:
Input :  

```
3
32
77
999
```

Output :  

```
NO
YES
YES
```
