# Problem K : Hatem's secret recipe

## Statement:
Hatem has a well-known Baklawa Shop. This is due to his great attention to quality and for never being late when it comes to orders. In fact, he and his partner had devised a recipe that made their Baklawas irresistible.
However, his partner is going on a family vacation for a whole month and fearful of someone stealing his recipe Hatem chooses to do all the work by himself.

Hatem has access to a lot of ovens that he can set up to match any order he gets where each oven has a capacity **c**. It takes him **k** time to set up one oven.
Each oven needs **f** time to cook **c** Baklawas.

Mister Hatem wants to know the number of ovens needed to bake all the *n* Baklawas in the minimum time possible.

**NOTE:**

->Because He is doing all the work by himself, Hatem can't cook in an oven while setting another : He finishes setting all the ovens he needs **then**, he would start cooking.

->The time needed to take the cooked Baklawas out of the oven and start cooking the next c Baklawas **is ignored** : Mister Hatem is so quick.

->All Baklawas are ready at the same moment **f** time after they started baking.

## Input :
The first line contains a single integer **T** (**TODO**) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.

Each test case consists of one line which contains  integers **n**, **k**, **c**, **f**( **TODO** ) — where :
 
    n is the number of ordered Baklawas.
    k is the time needed to set an oven.
    c is the capacity of one oven.
    f is the time to cook c Baklawas in one oven.
## Output :
For each test case, output the number of ovens that satisfies his needs.  

## Example:
Input :

Output :
